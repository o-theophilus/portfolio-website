			As a Designer & Developer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design â€” combining
			my technical knowledge with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product. My goal is
			to always build applications that are scalable and efficient under the hood while providing
			engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.

			<br />
			<br />

			I've always been fascinated by crafting digital experiences that people love. From building my
			own projects to contributing to open-source communities, I enjoy the thrill of turning ideas
			into reality. I believe in the power of collaboration and learning from others, which has
			shaped my approach to design and development.

			<br />
			<br />
			When I am not designing or programming, you can find me playing music, exploring my surroundings,
			or spending time with my family and friends. I believe that a balanced and fulfilling life is essential
			to creative inspiration and success.
