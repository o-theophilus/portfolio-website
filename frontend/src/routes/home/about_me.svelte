			<strong class="ititle">About Me</strong>
			<br /><br />

			My name is <strong>Theophilus</strong>, and I am a self-taught programmer and designer with a
			passion for learning and growing. I am always seeking new challenges and opportunities to
			expand my skills and knowledge.

			<br /> <br />
			I spend most of my time working on personal projects, contributing to open source projects, and
			sharing my knowledge with others. I believe in the power of community and collaboration and have
			benefited greatly from the support and mentorship of others.
			<br /> <br />

			When I am not designing or programming, you can find me playing music, exploring my
			surroundings, or spending time with my family and friends. I believe that a balanced and
			fulfilling life is essential to creative inspiration and success.
