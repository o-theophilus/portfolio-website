		<p>
			My name is <strong>Theophilus</strong>, I am a self-taught student of programming and software development, and I spend way too much time
			and money pursuing this interest.
			<br />
			<br />
			I spend most of my free time working on building my skillset, contributing to Open Source projects,
			and trying to learn as much as I can. There have been many good people who have assisted me in
			learning this craft, and I try to pay that forward by helping others who may be newer than I.
			<br />
			<br />
			I have benefited in massive ways from the work of those who took the time to share their know-how
			on the internet. From various bloggers to programming forums, to the now ubiquitous Stack Overflow,
			I have, in Borg-like fashion, assimilated the experience and college education of some of the biggest
			(and not so big) names in the technology arena. Shamelessly!
			<br />
			<br />
			When Iâ€™m not writing code or designing, I tend to be playing music (my other passion), exploring
			my surroundings, and doing my best to experience life beyond the code editor.

		<h1>This Website</h1>
		<br />
		<p>
			This website was made with SvelteKit and deployed on Vercel. It's entirely static through the
			SvelteKit's SSG feature.
			<br />
			<br />
			Posts are written in Markdown, in-page codes are formatted using Highlight.js and then converted
			to nice-looking HTML at build-time.
			<br />
			<br />
			This website was originally built with C# and Razor then ported to React and now to SvelteKit because
			of its simplicity and ease of use.
			<br /><br />
			This website is an all-in-one blog, portfolio and pet project to try out new shiny things.
